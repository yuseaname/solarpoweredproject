        <p class="lede">
          A Savonius rotor is the “wind turbine you can actually build and understand” — two scoops that catch wind and spin at low speed.
          It won’t compete with a tall, efficient horizontal-axis turbine, but it’s a fantastic learning project:
          torque vs RPM, drag-based limits, and the reality of wind resources at backyard height.
          This guide focuses on safe construction, realistic output, and how to test like an engineer.

          <h2>Beginner explanation: why vertical-axis wind is appealing (and why it’s tricky)</h2>
          <p>
            A Savonius wind turbine is a vertical-axis rotor that uses wind drag to spin.
            Because it’s drag-based, it can start in lower winds and produces usable torque at low RPM — great for demos and DIY.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tradeoff is efficiency. Drag-based machines can’t “outrun” the wind like lift-based turbines can,
            so your maximum power per swept area is limited.
            That’s not a deal-breaker if your goal is learning, measurement, or a small trickle charge.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want the larger context of wind siting and expectations, read
            <a class="text-link" href="diy-small-wind-turbine-for-off-grid-battery-charging.html">the small wind turbine guide</a>.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="how-it-works" class="article-card">
          <h2>How a Savonius rotor works</h2>
          <p>
            A classic Savonius rotor is two half-cylinders offset so one scoop “catches” wind more than the other.
            The wind pushes the advancing scoop harder than it pushes the returning scoop, producing torque.
          </p>

          <h3>Helical vs straight blades</h3>
          <p>
            Straight Savonius rotors can pulse (torque changes during rotation).
            A helical twist smooths torque and can reduce vibration — but it’s harder to build.
            For a first project, a straight rotor is fine as long as you mount it securely and measure carefully.
          </p>

          <h3>Why it has high torque but low RPM</h3>
          <p>
            The rotor pushes against the wind like a paddle.
            This produces torque (good for starting), but it also creates drag that limits top speed.
            That’s why gearing or belt ratio matters if you’re driving a generator that likes higher RPM.
          </p>

        <article id="build" class="article-card">
          <h2>DIY build paths (Version 1 → Version 3)</h2>
          <p>
            The safest and most successful DIY wind projects start small, prove the concept, then scale.
            Treat your first build as an experiment: you’re learning rotor behavior and wind at your site.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 1: tabletop rotor + measurements (no battery)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blades:</strong> two pieces of PVC pipe cut lengthwise (or thin sheet wrapped into half-cylinders).</li>
            <li><strong>End plates:</strong> plywood or plastic circles to keep the blades aligned.</li>
            <li><strong>Shaft:</strong> straight rod through bearings.</li>
            <li><strong>Load:</strong> none at first; measure RPM vs wind and check vibration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Put it in a safe wind stream (not near traffic, power lines, or people).
            If it wobbles, fix balance before you add a generator.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 2: add generator + adjustable load</h3>
          <p>
            A common DIY approach is using a permanent-magnet DC motor as a generator and a belt drive for ratio changes.
            Many “it doesn’t work” stories come from trying to couple directly with a generator that needs high RPM.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Generator:</strong> treadmill motor, scooter motor, or other PMDC motor.</li>
            <li><strong>Drive:</strong> belt and pulleys so you can test multiple ratios.</li>
            <li><strong>Load control:</strong> a resistor bank or buck converter into a resistive load.</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> DC watt meter to measure watts on a real load.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

          </p>

          <h3>Version 3: outdoor mounting with a real tower plan</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have a rotor that spins smoothly and produces stable watts, then you can mount it higher and test daily energy.
            Don’t start with a tall tower unless you already have experience and a safe site.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Guyed mast</strong> or sturdy post with clear fall zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect</strong> and ability to stop the rotor (brake or furling is harder on VAWTs).</li>
            <li><strong>Weatherproofing</strong> for bearings and electrical connections.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="tower" class="article-card">
          <h2>Mounting, towers, and safety basics</h2>
          <p>
            Wind projects fail most often because of siting and structure, not because the rotor shape is wrong.
            Wind is strongest and smoothest above obstacles. Close to the ground, wind is turbulent and weaker.
          </p>

          <h3>Height matters more than you want it to</h3>
          <p>
            If your rotor is below roofline and surrounded by trees, your effective wind resource may be so low that your turbine “works” but makes almost no energy.
            That’s not a moral failure — it’s physics.
          </p>

          <h3>Build for vibration</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use real bearings and rigid mounts.</li>
            <li>Balance the rotor before outdoor mounting.</li>
            <li>Plan for gust loads; “it survived a calm day” is not a test.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <div class="ad-slot">Ad slot</div>

        <article id="math" class="article-card">
          <h2>Realistic output estimates (watts and Wh/day)</h2>
          <p>
            Power in wind increases with the cube of wind speed.
            That’s why wind projects feel confusing: a small increase in wind speed can double or triple power.
          </p>
          <p>
            A useful mental model for “how much power is even available” is the wind power equation:
            <strong>P ≈ 0.5 × ρ × A × v³ × Cp</strong>.
            Here ρ is air density, A is swept area, v is wind speed, and Cp is a performance factor (efficiency).
            The key takeaway is not the exact number — it’s that <strong>v³ dominates</strong>, and a Savonius rotor’s Cp is typically modest because it is drag-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why “same rotor, different yard” produces wildly different results.
            If your site is sheltered and turbulent, your effective wind speed is low and inconsistent, so energy output stays low no matter how clean your build is.
          </p>

          <h3>Use Wh/day as your scoreboard</h3>
          <p>
            A turbine that makes 30W in a steady breeze is more useful than one that makes 200W in rare gusts.
            Track watt-hours per day with a meter or data logger.
          </p>

          <h3>A simple way to estimate energy from measurements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Measure average watts over a time window (say 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Repeat during different conditions (calm, typical breeze, strong breeze).</li>
            <li>Estimate daily energy by multiplying a “typical” watt level by typical hours of usable wind.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Example: If you often see ~15W for ~8 hours of breezy conditions, that’s ~120 Wh/day.
            That’s enough for device charging and small lights, but not a refrigerator.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Savonius turbines often “feel strong” but don’t deliver huge energy</h3>
          <p>
            High torque at low RPM makes the rotor feel powerful.
            But generator efficiency, low RPM, and limited aerodynamic efficiency cap total watts.
            This is why Savonius rotors are excellent teaching tools and “always-on trickle” experiments, not a primary energy source for most homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want your measurements to translate into something useful, keep a simple log:
            wind conditions, average watts, peak watts, and how long the output stays above a minimum (for example, above 10W).
            That “time above a threshold” often predicts real usability better than a single peak number.

          <h2>Charging a battery safely</h2>
          <p>
            Wind output is variable. That variability is exactly why you should use regulation and protection before charging batteries.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimum safe wiring concepts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rectify/regulate</strong> generator output before the battery.</li>
            <li><strong>Fuse near the battery</strong> so a short doesn’t turn cables into heaters.</li>
            <li><strong>Dump load or current limiting</strong> so voltage doesn’t run away when the battery is full or disconnected.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect switch</strong> you can reach quickly.</li>

          <h2>Safety and limitations</h2>
          <h3>Spinning parts</h3>
          <p>
            Even slow rotors can hurt you. Keep hands and loose clothing away.
            Use guards where practical, and don’t mount near walkways.
          </p>

          <h3>Tower safety</h3>
          <p>
            A failed mount can turn a “small turbine” into a falling object problem.
            Build with a clear fall zone, and don’t install near power lines.
          </p>

          <h3>Electrical protection</h3>
          <p>
            Wind systems can generate voltage spikes under gusty conditions and when loads disconnect.
            Use appropriate regulation, fusing, and a safe way to stop or disconnect the turbine.

            <div>
              <h4>Is a Savonius turbine worth building?</h4>
              <p>
                Yes as an educational project and for small “always-on” experiments.
                For serious off-grid power, tall, well-sited lift-based turbines usually deliver more energy per area.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Can it charge a 12V battery?</h4>
              <p>
                It can, but you need regulation and protection.
                A turbine that “hits 14V” open-circuit may still struggle to provide charging current under load.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>What’s the easiest rotor material?</h4>
              <p>
                PVC pipe cut lengthwise is common for small rotors because it’s consistent and weather-resistant.
                Thin sheet material also works if you can keep the shape rigid.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Do I need a tall tower?</h4>
              <p>
                For meaningful energy, height helps a lot. For learning and short tests, you can start low — just expect low output.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Should I build this instead of a small horizontal turbine?</h4>
              <p>
                Build a Savonius if you want simplicity and a clear learning project.
                If your goal is more energy, read the
