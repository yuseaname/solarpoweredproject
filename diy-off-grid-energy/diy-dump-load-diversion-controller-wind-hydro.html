        <h1 class="article-title">DIY Dump Load (Diversion Control) for Wind and Hydro: Keep Batteries Safe When Output Spikes</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          Solar charging is mostly simple: when the battery is full, the controller limits charge.
          Wind and hydro experiments can be different.
          A turbine can keep pushing power when the battery is already full — and if that energy has nowhere to go, voltage can rise and things can fail.
          A dump load (also called diversion control) gives your system a safe place to send excess energy.
          This guide explains what diversion does, how to size it realistically, and how to wire it safely.

          <h2>Beginner explanation: diversion is “somewhere safe for power to go”</h2>
          <p>
            A dump load is intentionally wasteful. That’s the point.
            When your generator produces more power than the battery can safely accept, the system diverts the extra power into a load that converts it to heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like a pressure relief valve in plumbing:
            you don’t want to “use” that water — you want to avoid bursting pipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re new to watts vs watt-hours, read
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-basics.html">solar basics</a>.
            Diversion control is about managing watts in real time to keep voltage stable and components safe.

        <article id="why-needed" class="article-card">
          <h2>Why “battery full” is a problem for wind and hydro experiments</h2>
          <p>
            Batteries are not bottomless.
            When a battery is full, it should not keep absorbing charging power at the same rate.
            In a well-designed system, charging current tapers or is stopped.
          </p>

          <h3>What turbines do when the battery can’t accept power</h3>
          <p>
            If a turbine keeps producing energy but the electrical system can’t absorb it, one of three things tends to happen:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Voltage rises</strong> (danger to electronics and batteries).</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical overspeed</strong> (danger to blades, bearings, and couplers).</li>
            <li><strong>Uncontrolled heating</strong> (diodes, wiring, regulators, and connectors can overheat).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Diversion is a controlled way to prevent the “nowhere to go” condition.
          </p>

          <h3>Why solar often feels easier</h3>
          <p>
            Solar panels can be “turned down” by a controller because they are current-limited sources that respond predictably.
            Turbines can behave differently: changes in electrical load can change RPM and can create unstable behavior if not managed.

        <article id="how-it-works" class="article-card">
          <h2>How diversion control works</h2>
          <p>
            A diversion controller monitors battery (or DC bus) voltage.
            When voltage rises above a threshold (indicating “battery full” or “charging should be limited”), the controller routes current to a dump load.
          </p>

          <h3>Diversion vs series regulation (high-level)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Series regulation:</strong> reduces or interrupts current flowing into the battery.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversion regulation:</strong> keeps the generator loaded by sending excess current to another load.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In many wind/hydro situations, keeping the generator loaded is desirable because it helps prevent overspeed.
          </p>

          <h3>PWM diversion (the common pattern)</h3>
          <p>
            Many diversion systems pulse current to the dump load (PWM) to control average power smoothly.
            The dump load still gets hot — but now it’s controllably hot.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="dump-load" class="article-card">
          <h2>What a dump load actually is</h2>
          <p>
            A dump load is simply a device that can safely convert electrical power into heat continuously.
            For DIY builds, that often means resistors or heating elements.
          </p>

          <h3>Common dump load types</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Resistor bank</strong> (wirewound resistors mounted to a heat sink or metal enclosure).</li>
            <li><strong>Heating element</strong> (air heater or water heater element) sized for your voltage.</li>
            <li><strong>Automotive bulbs</strong> (useful for low-power demos, not for higher power continuous dumping).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The “best” choice depends on power level and how you want to handle heat.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="sizing" class="article-card">
          <h2>Sizing a dump load (watts and resistance)</h2>
          <p>
            A dump load must handle the maximum power your turbine could plausibly produce in your conditions (or at least the portion you want to divert),
            plus a safety margin.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1: estimate maximum plausible watts</h3>
          <p>
            Use measured reality, not optimistic ratings.
            If your wind turbine has produced 120W peaks on a meter, assume the dump load should handle at least that, and preferably more.
            For hydro, you can estimate water power from head and flow (then apply a conservative efficiency).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want a measurement-first method, use a generator test bench approach.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2: choose a voltage basis (12V / 24V / 48V)</h3>
          <p>
            Dump load sizing depends strongly on voltage because for resistive loads:
          </p>
          <p class="article-meta"><strong>P = V² / R</strong></p>
          <p>
            At higher voltage, the same resistance dissipates more power. At lower voltage, current rises for the same power, which increases wiring demands.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3: choose resistance and power rating</h3>
          <p>
            Suppose you want to dump about 200W on a 12V system.
            The effective resistance needed is roughly:
          </p>
          <p class="article-meta"><strong>R ≈ V² / P = 12² / 200 ≈ 0.72Ω</strong></p>
          <p>
            That’s a low resistance, which means high current (about 16–17A at 12V).
            That current must be handled by wiring, switches, and connectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, resistors must be rated for the heat.
            A “200W dump load” is literally a 200W heater.
            If you build a 200W resistor bank with no airflow or heat sinking, it will overheat.
          </p>

          <h3>Build in margin</h3>
          <p>
            A good DIY rule is to oversize thermal handling.
            If you think you need 200W, aim for a dump load that can safely dissipate more under your mounting conditions.
          </p>

        <article id="wiring" class="article-card">
          <h2>Safe wiring patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Diversion systems involve high current, and they are often installed in environments where wind/hydro is already stressing hardware.
            Build for safety and serviceability.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimum protection concepts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fuse near the battery</strong> and near other energy sources as appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect</strong> so you can stop the experiment quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Wire sized for current</strong> and run length to reduce voltage drop and heating.</li>

          <h3>Where diversion fits in a simple system</h3>
          <p>
            The conceptual model is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Generator charges battery</strong> (through appropriate rectification/regulation).</li>
            <li><strong>Diversion controller monitors battery voltage.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dump load absorbs excess power</strong> when voltage rises beyond a threshold.</li>

        <article id="heat" class="article-card">
          <h2>Heat management and mounting</h2>
          <p>
            A dump load is a heater. Treat it like one.
            You need:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-combustible mounting</strong> (metal enclosure or heat sink).</li>
            <li><strong>Airflow</strong> (vents, spacing, or forced air if needed).</li>
            <li><strong>Physical clearance</strong> from plastic, wood, and insulation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Thermal failure is a predictable failure</h3>
          <p>
            If your dump load is undersized or enclosed without airflow, it will overheat.
            If it fails open-circuit, the system may lose its safety valve at the worst time (high wind, full battery).
            That’s why oversizing and conservative mounting matter.

          <p>
            Dump loads can reach high temperatures.
            Treat them like a space heater: keep them away from combustible materials and plan airflow.

            <div>
              <h4>Do I need a dump load for a small wind turbine?</h4>
              <p>
                Often, yes — especially if you plan to charge a battery and the turbine can continue producing power when the battery is full.
                The need depends on your turbine type, controller behavior, and how your system handles “excess power” scenarios.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Can I use a water heater element as a dump load?</h4>
              <p>
                Sometimes. Heating elements can handle heat by design, but you must choose an element appropriate for your system voltage and mounting.
                Wire and protect it as a high-power device, not as an accessory.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>How do I size a dump load for 12V or 24V?</h4>
              <p>
                Estimate maximum plausible watts to dump, then use P = V² / R to select an effective resistance and wattage rating.
                Oversize thermal handling and pay attention to current (especially at 12V).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Is diversion the same as braking?</h4>
              <p>
                Diversion loads the generator electrically, which can slow the turbine and reduce overspeed risk.
                It is not always a full mechanical brake, and it’s not a substitute for safe turbine design and mounting.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>What’s the safest way to start?</h4>
              <p>
                Start with measurement-first experiments and conservative power levels.
                Confirm your dump load can dissipate heat safely before relying on it as a protection device.
