          <h2>What micro-hydro is (and what it is not)</h2>
          <p>
            Micro-hydro means using a small water turbine (or water wheel) and generator to convert the energy in moving water into electricity.
            It’s not “free energy” — the source is the water’s gravitational potential energy (from elevation) or kinetic energy (from moving flow).
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason micro-hydro is so attractive off-grid is that it can run day and night if the water source is steady.
            A modest continuous power source can beat a larger intermittent source, because energy adds up over time.

          <h2>Head vs flow: the two measurements that matter</h2>
          <p>
            If micro-hydro projects fail, it’s usually because the site’s head or flow was guessed instead of measured.
            You can’t cheat either one.
          </p>

          <h3>Head (H): vertical drop, not pipe length</h3>
          <p>
            Head is the vertical height difference between where you take water in and where you discharge it.
            People often confuse head with the length of the pipe (penstock). The pipe length matters for friction losses, but head is about elevation change.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll also see “gross head” and “net head.” Gross head is the elevation difference on paper.
            Net head is what you get after losses (mainly pipe friction and bends). Net head is what you should use in the power equation.
          </p>

          <h3>Flow (Q): how much water you can count on</h3>
          <p>
            Flow is the volume of water per second you can reliably divert through your turbine.
            Seasonal changes are everything: the best-looking creek in spring can be a trickle in late summer.
            If the project is meant for year-round use, size for your <em>reliable</em> flow, not the peak.
          </p>

          <h3>Quick unit conversion: liters per second</h3>
          <p>
            Many DIY measurements end up in liters per second (L/s). Since 1 L = 0.001 m³:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 L/s = 0.001 m³/s</li>
            <li>10 L/s = 0.01 m³/s</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="article-card">
          <h2>Example calculation (so the numbers feel real)</h2>
          <p>
            Suppose you measure:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Net head: H = 12 m</li>
            <li>Reliable flow: Q = 8 L/s = 0.008 m³/s</li>
            <li>Overall efficiency: η = 0.45 (a conservative DIY estimate)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Water power available before efficiency is:
            ρ g Q H ≈ 1000 × 9.81 × 0.008 × 12 ≈ 942 W.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electrical output estimate is:
            P ≈ η × 942 W ≈ 0.45 × 942 ≈ <strong>424 W</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            424 W continuous is not a huge number — but it runs all day:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Daily energy: 424 W × 24 h ≈ <strong>10.2 kWh/day</strong></li>
            <li>Monthly energy: ≈ 306 kWh/month</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That’s why steady micro-hydro can feel “big” in real life: the wattage is modest, the runtime is relentless.

          <h2>How to measure head and flow (DIY-friendly methods)</h2>
          <p>
            You do not need specialized surveying gear to get a usable first estimate.
            What you do need is to measure methodically and to repeat measurements across seasons.
          </p>

          <h3>Measuring head</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Map + spot check</strong>: start with a mapping app for rough elevation difference, then verify with on-site measurements.</li>
            <li><strong>Hose level</strong>: a long clear hose filled with water can act as a simple level to measure elevation change in segments.</li>
            <li><strong>Segment method</strong>: measure smaller drops (for example 1–2 meters at a time) and add them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whatever method you use, remember you want <strong>net head</strong> at the turbine.
            If you ignore penstock friction, your calculation will be optimistic.
          </p>

          <h3>Measuring flow</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bucket timing</strong> (small flows): divert into a bucket of known volume and time how long it takes to fill. Flow is volume ÷ time.</li>
            <li><strong>Container + stopwatch</strong>: same idea with larger containers for higher flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Float method</strong> (rough estimate): measure a stream cross-section area and surface velocity; this is less accurate but can be a starting point.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For off-grid planning, the best number is your <strong>reliable low-season flow</strong>, not the best day you’ve ever seen.
            If you only measure once, assume you measured during a “good” period and de-rate your estimate.

          <h2>How it works (system overview)</h2>
          <p>
            A typical micro-hydro setup has two big halves: the water side and the electrical side.
            Good projects treat both seriously.
          </p>

          <h3>Water side</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intake</strong>: diverts some water into your system (not necessarily all flow).</li>
            <li><strong>Screen / trash rack</strong>: keeps debris out; needs regular maintenance.</li>
            <li><strong>Forebay / settling box</strong>: calms flow and drops sand before the penstock.</li>
            <li><strong>Penstock</strong>: the pipe from forebay to turbine; diameter and smoothness strongly affect losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Nozzle(s)</strong> (for impulse turbines): converts pressure to a high-velocity jet.</li>
            <li><strong>Turbine runner</strong>: converts jet/flow energy to shaft torque.</li>
            <li><strong>Tailrace</strong>: returns water to the stream safely (don’t undermine banks).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Electrical side</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Generator</strong>: makes electrical power from the turbine shaft.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectifier</strong> (if needed): converts AC to DC for battery charging.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation</strong>: keeps voltage and current within safe limits, often via a controller and diversion load.</li>
            <li><strong>Battery bank</strong>: stores energy; choose chemistry/voltage intentionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverter</strong>: converts battery DC to household AC loads if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection</strong>: fuses/breakers, disconnects, and appropriate wire sizing.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          <h2>Turbine types (high-head vs low-head)</h2>
          <p>
            Turbine selection depends mostly on whether your site has high head and low flow, or low head and high flow.
            For DIY projects, you’ll most often see these broad categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Impulse turbines</strong> (like Pelton-style runners): best for <strong>higher head</strong> and <strong>lower flow</strong>. A nozzle creates a fast jet that hits buckets on the runner.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaction turbines</strong> (various types): better for <strong>lower head</strong> and <strong>higher flow</strong>; water pressure changes through the turbine and casing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You don’t need to become a turbine designer to stay realistic.
            What matters is understanding that the same “water power” can be difficult to harvest if your site pushes you into a turbine category that’s hard to implement well.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="article-card">
          <h2>Where the losses come from (why efficiency matters)</h2>
          <p>
            The equation uses η for a reason: micro-hydro is a chain of conversions.
            A small loss at each step can add up to a big difference from the ideal number.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Penstock friction</strong>: long runs, small diameter, rough pipe, and lots of bends reduce net head.</li>
            <li><strong>Turbine mismatch</strong>: wrong runner/nozzle sizing for your head/flow wastes power.</li>
            <li><strong>Generator losses</strong>: copper loss, magnetic loss, and heating reduce output.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification and regulation</strong>: converting and controlling power has efficiency penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>Battery charging losses</strong>: not all input becomes stored energy (heat, internal resistance, BMS behavior).</li>
            <li><strong>Inverter losses</strong>: running AC loads adds conversion loss on top of everything else.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is why “battery-first” designs are often simpler: stabilize the system around a known battery voltage, then invert to AC if needed.
            If you’re deciding between 12V, 24V, and 48V battery systems, see:

        <article class="article-card">
          <h2>Penstock basics (the pipe can make or break the project)</h2>
          <p>
            The penstock is the pipe that turns elevation into pressure at the turbine.
            It also creates one of the most important losses: friction.
            In practical terms, a penstock that’s too small or too rough can erase a large portion of your “net head.”
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Diameter</strong>: larger diameter generally reduces friction loss but costs more and is harder to handle.</li>
            <li><strong>Length</strong>: longer pipe increases loss; route efficiently, but don’t create unsafe slopes or unstable trenches.</li>
            <li><strong>Bends and fittings</strong>: sharp turns add loss; design smoother transitions where possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Air management</strong>: trapped air can reduce performance and create unstable flow; design so air can purge.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You don’t need perfect calculations to stay realistic.
            The key is to treat the penstock as a first-class part of the system — not an afterthought — and to expect that it will reduce your net head.

          <h2>Electrical regulation: keeping voltage safe as the stream changes</h2>
          <p>
            A micro-hydro generator often wants to produce more voltage when unloaded and less when heavily loaded.
            Without regulation, that variability can damage electronics or charge batteries incorrectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many small hydro systems use some form of <strong>load control</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Battery charging control</strong>: a charger/controller limits battery current and voltage.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversion (dump) load</strong>: when the battery is full, excess power is diverted to a resistive load (often heating water/air) to keep generator loading stable.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverter/charger hybrid</strong>: some systems centralize charging and inversion so multiple sources can feed the same battery bus safely.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            The same mindset applies: keep voltages within limits, protect conductors, and verify behavior with measurements.

          <h2>Maintenance checklist (micro-hydro is a living system)</h2>
          <p>
            Micro-hydro is rarely “install it and forget it.”
            Expect regular inspection and maintenance, especially during leaf season, storms, and freeze/thaw cycles.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check intake screens and remove debris before it starves the turbine.</li>
            <li>Inspect the penstock for leaks, movement, UV damage, and anchor issues.</li>
            <li>Verify that protective devices (fuses/breakers) are correctly rated and not bypassed.</li>
            <li>Look for unusual vibration/noise at the turbine and generator.</li>
            <li>Confirm charging voltage/current behavior as the battery approaches full.</li>

          <p>
            Micro-hydro and solar complement each other:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Solar often peaks in summer; many streams also have seasonal patterns, but not always aligned.</li>
            <li>Micro-hydro can provide overnight energy that solar cannot.</li>
            <li>Together, they can reduce battery cycling depth (which can extend battery life).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In practice, you typically size the battery and inverter for the loads you want, then treat generation sources as charging inputs.
            If your goal is to reduce generator runtime, compare the economics in:

          </p>
          <p>
            A hybrid setup can also simplify troubleshooting because you can isolate sources.
            If you’re chasing inconsistent output, you may find the troubleshooting patterns similar to solar:

          <h2>Safety, legality, and environmental reality checks</h2>
          <p>
            Micro-hydro is not just a “plug and play” gadget. Your biggest constraints are often not electrical — they’re physical and regulatory.
          </p>
          <h3>Electrical and battery safety</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Overcurrent protection</strong>: use appropriately sized fuses/breakers and place them correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Wire sizing</strong>: undersized conductors can overheat; voltage drop can cause equipment misbehavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnects</strong>: plan for a safe way to isolate the generator/controller and the battery bank.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Use these as your baseline references:

            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-combiner-box-and-disconnect-guide.html">combiner boxes and disconnects</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Mechanical and water safety</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spinning machinery</strong>: guard shafts and belts; treat turbine runners like power tools.</li>
            <li><strong>High-pressure water</strong>: penstocks can hold significant pressure; use appropriate pipe ratings and secure anchors.</li>
            <li><strong>Debris and ice</strong>: intakes clog; freezing can burst pipes; floods can destroy hardware.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Legal and environmental constraints</h3>
          <p>
            Many places regulate water diversion, fish passage, stream modifications, and property/usage rights.
            If you cannot legally divert flow or construct an intake, the project may be a non-starter.
            Treat this as step zero and verify local rules.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <h3>How much power do I need for “useful” off-grid living?</h3>
          <p>
            It depends on the loads. A cabin running lights, electronics, and efficient refrigeration might average a few hundred watts but with higher peaks.
            Start with a load estimate and work backward:
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-system-sizing.html">solar system sizing</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Should I design micro-hydro to run AC loads directly?</h3>
          <p>
            For many small DIY systems, it’s simpler to charge a battery bank and then run AC loads from an inverter.
            That gives you stable voltage and lets you keep generation and consumption decoupled.
            Inverter selection matters; see:
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-inverter-sizing.html">solar inverter sizing</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Is micro-hydro “better” than solar?</h3>
          <p>
            If your water source is reliable and legal to use, micro-hydro can be incredible because it’s continuous.
            If the site is seasonal, remote, or high-maintenance, solar may be cheaper and easier.
            Many real systems are hybrids.
          </p>

          <h3>What’s the biggest beginner mistake?</h3>
          <p>
            Assuming the stream you see today is the stream you’ll have year-round.
            Measure and design around reliable conditions, then treat anything better as a bonus.
