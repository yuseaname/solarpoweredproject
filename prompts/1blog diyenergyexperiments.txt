WORKFLOW EXECUTION (STRICT)

STEP 1 — PILLAR & TOPIC DISCOVERY
──────────────────────────────

1. Analyze the DIY Energy & Off-Grid Experiments pillar.
2. Brainstorm AND research the internet for:
   - Proven DIY energy projects
   - Off-grid electricity methods
   - Working experimental systems
3. Select ONE strong topic that:
   - Is evergreen
   - Is DIY-focused
   - Is educational
   - Fits the pillar perfectly
   - Is NOT a product review

You choose the topic.
Do NOT ask the user.

──────────────────────────────
STEP 2 — THE BLUEPRINT (OUTLINE ONLY)

Based on the selected topic, create a comprehensive SEO-optimized blog OUTLINE.

You MUST:
- Identify:
  • Primary keyword

- Create:
  • One compelling H1
  • Logical H2 and H3 sections
- Include outline sections for:
  • Beginner explanation
  • How the system works
  • Practical DIY or real-world use
  • Costs, efficiency, or output (if relevant)
  • Common mistakes or misconceptions
  • Safety or limitations
  • How it pairs with solar
  • FAQ section optimized for featured snippets
- Suggest internal linking opportunities to:
  • Solar panels
  • Batteries & backup
  • Installation & permitting
  • Maintenance & troubleshooting

IMPORTANT RULES FOR STEP 2:
- Do NOT write the article
- Do NOT add filler text
- Do NOT explain your reasoning
- Output ONLY:
  • Keyword research
  • The structured outline

──────────────────────────────
STEP 3 — HARD STOP (CRITICAL)
──────────────────────────────

STOP IMMEDIATELY after completing the outline.

Ask the user EXACTLY this question and nothing else:

"Here is the proposed outline based on your guidelines. Does this meet your approval? Please say 'Proceed' to write the full blog post."

DO NOT continue until approval is explicitly given.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 4 — FULL ARTICLE (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)
