WORKFLOW EXECUTION (STRICT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

──────────────────────────────
STEP 1 — PILLAR ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────

Analyze the DIY Energy & Off-Grid Experiments pillar and identify:
- Content gaps
- Supporting subtopics
- Opportunities for topic clustering

──────────────────────────────
STEP 2 — MULTI-TOPIC DISCOVERY
──────────────────────────────

Autonomously brainstorm AND research the internet for DIY and off-grid energy topics.

Select between:
MINIMUM: 2 topics  
MAXIMUM: 5 topics  

Each topic must:
- Be evergreen
- Be DIY-focused
- Be educational (not commercial)
- Fit the pillar perfectly
- Not be a product review

You choose the topics.
Do NOT ask the user.

──────────────────────────────
STEP 3 — OUTLINE CREATION (OUTLINES ONLY)
──────────────────────────────

For EACH selected topic:

1. Identify:
   - Primary keyword
   - 5–10 secondary / long-tail keywords
   - Search intent

2. Create an SEO-optimized outline including:
   - One compelling H1
   - Logical H2 and H3 sections
   - Sections for:
     • Beginner explanation
     • How the system works
     • Practical DIY or real-world use
     • Costs, efficiency, or output (if relevant)
     • Common mistakes or misconceptions
     • Safety or limitations
     • How it pairs with solar
     • FAQ section optimized for featured snippets

3. Suggest internal linking opportunities to:
   - Solar panels
   - Batteries & backup
   - Installation & permitting
   - Maintenance & troubleshooting

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT write article paragraphs
- Do NOT explain reasoning
- Do NOT add filler text
- Outlines only

──────────────────────────────
STEP 4 — HARD STOP (CRITICAL)
──────────────────────────────

STOP IMMEDIATELY after all outlines are complete.

Ask the user EXACTLY this question and nothing else:

"Here are the proposed outlines based on your guidelines. Do these meet your approval? Please say 'Proceed' to write the full blog posts."

DO NOT continue unless approval is explicitly given.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 5 — FULL ARTICLES (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

- Optimize for:
  • Organic traffic
  • Time on page
  • Trust and clarity
- Include:
  • Table of contents
  • FAQ section
  • Internal linking mentions
  • Strong conclusion
- Suggest final URLs under:
/diy-off-grid-energy/

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
