        <p class="lede">
          Series vs parallel is one of the biggest “forks in the road” for a solar build. The good news: you don’t need an engineering degree. You need a
          clear goal (reliable energy) and a short checklist that matches your shading, wiring distance, and charge controller limits.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Choose series</strong> if you have longer cable runs, you’re using an MPPT controller, and shading is minimal/consistent.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose parallel</strong> if partial shading is common (trees, vents), or you need to keep voltage low due to controller limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose series-parallel</strong> (a mix) when you need both: higher voltage than pure parallel, but not as shade-sensitive as a long series string.</li>

            The reader is the hero: your job is simply to pick the wiring that prevents the two failures people hate—wasted solar production and wiring that

          <h2>The one concept that makes it click: voltage up vs current up</h2>
          <p>
            Wiring in <strong>series</strong> adds voltage (like stacking batteries end-to-end). Wiring in <strong>parallel</strong> adds current capacity
            (like widening the pipe).
          </p>
          <p class="pill"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> higher current usually drives thicker wire and higher-rated protection devices.</p>

          <h2>When series is usually better (and the main tradeoff)</h2>
          <h3>Longer wire runs (voltage drop advantage)</h3>
          <p>
            Higher array voltage often means lower current for the same power, which reduces voltage drop and can simplify wiring—especially when panels
            are far from the controller.

          </div>

          <h3>MPPT controllers and higher array voltage</h3>
          <p>
            MPPT controllers are often more flexible with higher input voltages (within limits) and can convert that voltage efficiently into battery
            charging current. This is a common reason people choose series strings.
          </p>

          <h3>The tradeoff: shading and mismatch can hurt more</h3>
          <p>
            In a series string, one weaker panel can pull down the string’s output. Good design tries to keep panels in a string seeing similar conditions.

        <article class="article-card" id="parallel">
          <h2>When parallel is usually better (and the main tradeoff)</h2>
          <h3>Partial shading and uneven conditions</h3>
          <p>
            If you expect frequent partial shading (roof vents, trees, seasonal shadows), parallel wiring can reduce how much one shaded panel affects the
            rest of the array.
          </p>

          <h3>The tradeoff: more current (often thicker wire + bigger protection)</h3>
          <p>
            Parallel wiring typically means higher array current, which can push you toward thicker cable, larger breakers/fuses, or a combiner solution.

          <h2>How this interacts with MPPT vs PWM (plain language)</h2>
          <p>
            Controller choice can change what “good wiring” means. MPPT often gives you more flexibility to run a higher-voltage array (again: within
            limits). PWM tends to push people toward keeping array voltage closely matched to the battery bank.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Exceeding controller limits:</strong> can cause shutdowns or damage; always design within voltage/current ratings.</li>
            <li><strong>Assuming “more panels” fixes shading:</strong> shading is a layout problem first, a panel-count problem second.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring wire run length:</strong> parallel can punish long distances with higher current and voltage drop.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixing mismatched panels:</strong> different specs in the same string often reduce real output.</li>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <div class="faq">
            <div>
              <h4>Is series or parallel “better”?</h4>
              <p>Neither is universally better. Series often helps with long runs and MPPT setups; parallel can be more forgiving with partial shading.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Does series increase watts?</h4>
              <p>It increases voltage, not “free power.” Total power depends on sunlight and panel output. Wiring changes how that power is delivered.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>What happens if one panel is shaded?</h4>
              <p>Shading can reduce output more in series strings. Design tries to group panels with similar sun exposure in the same string.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Can I mix series and parallel?</h4>
              <p>Yes, many arrays are built as series strings connected in parallel. The safe approach is to keep strings consistent and stay within controller limits.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Do I need MPPT for series wiring?</h4>
              <p>Not always, but MPPT often makes higher-voltage array configurations more practical and efficient (within equipment limits).</p>
