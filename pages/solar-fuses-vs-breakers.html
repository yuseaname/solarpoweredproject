          <ul>
            <li>Fuses and breakers both provide overcurrent protection, but they’re not interchangeable in every DC application.</li>
            <li>The best “upgrade” is often better placement and correct DC ratings, not more devices.</li>
            <li>Battery-to-inverter protection is commonly the highest priority because currents can be high.</li>

          <h2>Quick answer (for most small systems)</h2>
          <p>
            Think of it this way: the reader is the hero trying to keep a system safe and serviceable. The “guide” (this site) gives you a simple plan:
            protect the high-current paths, add safe isolation points, and verify DC ratings.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use fuses</strong> where you want simple, fast protection and you’re fine replacing the device after it trips.</li>
            <li><strong>Use DC-rated breakers</strong> where resettable protection (and sometimes switching) is useful.</li>
            <li><strong>Use disconnects</strong> for safe service isolation (disconnects are not automatically overcurrent protection).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What each device is good at</h2>
          <h3>Fuses (simple, fast, one-time)</h3>
          <p>
            A fuse is a deliberate weak link: it opens when current exceeds its rating. Many solar builds use fuses on the battery side because they’re
            straightforward and come in high-current options.
          </p>

          <h3>Breakers (resettable, but DC ratings matter)</h3>
          <p>
            A breaker is resettable and can be convenient for testing or maintenance. The key is that DC interrupt ratings and voltage ratings must match
            your design.
          </p>

          <h2>The five places people get protection wrong</h2>

          <h3>1) Battery-to-inverter protection</h3>
          <p>
            This is often where current is highest. Protection choices here should be tied to the inverter’s real draw, surge behavior, and the cable run.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>2) Controller-to-battery protection</h3>
          <p>
            Charge controllers can deliver substantial current into batteries. Protection here is about preventing wiring faults from turning into
            overheating or damage.

          </div>

          <h3>3) PV strings / combiner protection</h3>
          <p>
            Arrays with multiple strings may need string-level protection depending on the design. The safest approach is to follow the charge
            controller/combiner guidance for your configuration and voltage.
          </p>

            <a class="text-link" href="solar-panels-series-vs-parallel.html">Series vs parallel solar panels</a>
          </div>

          <h3>4) Loads and DC distribution</h3>
          <p>
            Small branch circuits (lights, DC outlets, fans) are where a clean distribution approach improves reliability. The goal is predictable
            protection, not “one big fuse for everything.”
          </p>

          <h3>5) Confusing disconnects with overcurrent protection</h3>
          <p>
            A disconnect makes a system safer to service, but it doesn’t necessarily protect wiring from overcurrent. Make sure you have both jobs covered
            where required.

        <article class="article-card" id="checklist">
          <h2>A shopping checklist that prevents unsafe mismatches</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>DC voltage rating:</strong> must be at or above your system voltage (and any array/open-circuit voltage where applicable).</li>
            <li><strong>Interrupt rating:</strong> the device must be able to safely open the circuit under fault conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Current rating:</strong> match the circuit’s expected maximum current with appropriate design margin.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature/environment:</strong> some devices are not meant for heat, moisture, or outdoor exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> match lugs, bus bars, cable size, and enclosure space.</li>
          </ul>

        <article class="article-card" id="mistakes">
          <h2>Common mistakes (risk → symptom → fix direction)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Using AC breakers on DC circuits:</strong> can fail to interrupt safely; only use devices rated for your DC application.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection too far from the battery:</strong> leaves more unprotected cable length than intended.</li>
            <li><strong>Sizing protection to “what I plan to use”:</strong> protection should match potential circuit current, not a guess of normal usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Using a disconnect as protection:</strong> different job; verify you have overcurrent protection where required.</li>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <div class="faq">
            <div>
              <h4>Do I need a fuse and a breaker?</h4>
              <p>Sometimes. Many systems use a fuse for primary protection and a breaker for convenience/isolation on certain circuits, but the right mix depends on the design.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>What does “DC-rated” actually mean?</h4>
              <p>It means the device is designed and tested to interrupt DC current safely at a specified DC voltage and fault level.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Where should the battery fuse go?</h4>
              <p>Placement is design- and code-dependent, but the core idea is to protect the wiring connected to the battery from fault current.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Do solar panels need fuses?</h4>
              <p>Some multi-string arrays do, depending on configuration. Follow your controller/combiner guidance and verify ratings for your array voltage.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Can a breaker be used as a switch?</h4>
              <p>Only if it’s rated for that use. Some DC breakers are designed for switching; others are not.</p>
