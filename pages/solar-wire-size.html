          If solar wiring feels intimidating, you’re not alone. The goal isn’t to memorize tables — it’s to make one safe decision: choose a wire size
          that keeps heat and voltage drop under control for <em>your</em> circuit.

        <article class="article-card" id="two-rules">
          <h2>Two rules that prevent most mistakes</h2>
          <h3>Rule 1: current (amps) drives heat risk</h3>
          <p>
            For a given load, lower voltage means higher current. High current pushes you toward thicker cable and higher-rated lugs, bus bars, fuses, and
            breakers.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>Rule 2: distance drives voltage drop</h3>
          <p>
            The longer the run (especially on high-current battery cables), the more voltage you lose in the wire. Too much drop can look like “the system
            is underperforming” when the real issue is wiring.

          <h3>Step 1: identify the circuit</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>PV wiring:</strong> panels to charge controller (often higher voltage, lower current)</li>
            <li><strong>Controller-to-battery:</strong> charging current to the battery bank</li>
            <li><strong>Battery-to-inverter:</strong> usually the highest current wiring in the system</li>

          </div>

          <h3>Step 2: estimate max amps (use labels, not guesses)</h3>
          <p>
            Use the equipment specs as your “source of truth.” For example, charge controllers list max output current, and inverters list continuous power
            and surge behavior.

          </div>

          <h3>Step 3: measure one-way run length</h3>
          <p>
            Don’t assume a tidy layout. Measure the real path the cable will take (including routing), and remember that long runs are most painful on
            high-current circuits.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: set a conservative voltage-drop target</h3>
          <p>
            If you want a simple rule for planning (not a code substitute), aim to keep voltage drop “small enough that it doesn’t change equipment
            behavior.” The battery-to-inverter run is often where people tighten this target because voltage sag can trigger low-voltage shutdowns.
          </p>
          <p class="article-meta">
            When in doubt, oversize cable rather than forcing a long, high-current run at a low voltage.

          <h2>12V vs 24V vs 48V: why higher voltage usually simplifies wiring</h2>
          <p>
            If you keep power roughly the same, higher voltage means lower current. Lower current typically means thinner wire, less voltage drop, and
            smaller (and sometimes cheaper) protection hardware. That’s why many systems “graduate” to 24V or 48V as power needs grow.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <div class="faq">
            <div>
              <h4>Is PV wire the same as battery cable?</h4>
              <p>No. PV wire is designed for outdoor array wiring. Battery cable is built for high current and flexible routing on the battery side.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>What voltage drop is “acceptable” for solar?</h4>
              <p>It depends on the circuit and equipment behavior. The safest approach is to keep drop low enough that it doesn’t cause shutdowns or lost production.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Why does 12V require thicker wire than 24V or 48V?</h4>
              <p>For the same power, lower voltage means higher current. Higher current drives thicker cable and higher-rated protection.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Can I oversize wire?</h4>
              <p>Often yes, and it’s a common way to reduce voltage drop and improve reliability. The practical limits are cost, routing, and connector compatibility.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Do I size for continuous watts or surge?</h4>
              <p>Use the maximum current that the circuit can realistically see. For inverters, surge can be relevant depending on your loads and design.</p>
