        <p class="lede">
          Battery pricing is often discussed as “cost per kWh,” but the most useful number is cost per <em>usable</em> kWh over the battery’s lifespan.
          This guide explains the ranges, what changes the price, and a practical way to compare options.

            A common range is <strong>$200 to $900 per kWh</strong>, depending on chemistry, quality tier, and whether the price includes integrated
            electronics (like a battery management system).

          <h2>Use “cost per usable kWh” (not nameplate kWh)</h2>
          <p>
            A battery’s nameplate capacity isn’t always the amount you should regularly use. Many systems are sized around a depth of discharge (DoD)
            target to protect lifespan.
          </p>
          <p class="pill"><strong>Usable kWh</strong> ≈ Nameplate kWh × DoD</p>
          <p>
            Example: A 10 kWh battery used to 80% DoD has about <strong>8 kWh usable</strong> in typical operation.

          <h2>A practical comparison: cost per lifetime usable kWh</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to compare long-term value, estimate total lifetime energy delivered.
          </p>
          <p class="pill">
            <strong>Lifetime usable kWh</strong> ≈ Usable kWh × Cycle life
          </p>
          <p>
            Then compare price to lifetime usable kWh. This doesn’t need to be perfect to be useful; it prevents obvious mismatches where a cheaper
            battery has much lower usable capacity or a far shorter lifespan.

          <h2>What drives battery price the most</h2>
          <h3>1) Chemistry</h3>
          <p>
            Chemistry impacts usable depth of discharge, energy density, and cycle life, which affects both upfront price and long-term value.
          </p>
          <h3>2) Integrated electronics and system compatibility</h3>
          <p>
            Some batteries include integrated monitoring, protections, and communications that can simplify installation but add cost.
          </p>
          <h3>3) Warranty and cycle rating</h3>
          <p>
            Longer warranties and higher cycle ratings often increase price. Use these numbers to compare “value” rather than focusing only on $/kWh.
          </p>
          <h3>4) Temperature and operating conditions</h3>
          <p>
            Batteries may need temperature management depending on climate. Total cost should include what it takes to keep the battery in its safe range.

          <h2>Batteries in the full system budget</h2>
          <p>
            In grid-tied systems without backup, batteries may be optional. In off-grid or whole-home backup systems, batteries can dominate the budget.
            Use a full system breakdown to keep estimates realistic.

            <div>
              <h4>Why is lithium more expensive per kWh?</h4>
              <p>Lithium systems often have higher usable capacity, better efficiency, and longer cycle life, which can improve long-term value.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>What’s the biggest mistake when comparing battery prices?</h4>
              <p>Comparing nameplate kWh only. Always compare usable kWh and expected cycle life.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>How many kWh do I need for backup?</h4>
              <p>It depends on your daily energy use and how long you want to run critical loads. Start with a load estimate and autonomy target.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Do batteries always improve payback?</h4>
              <p>Not always. Batteries can be about resilience and backup rather than pure payback, depending on rates and use case.</p>
