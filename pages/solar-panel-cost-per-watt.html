          “Cost per watt” is the simplest way to compare solar panels across sizes and brands. This guide explains typical price ranges,
          what changes them, and how to estimate your panel budget without guessing.

            <li>Panel pricing is commonly compared as dollars per watt ($/W).</li>
            <li>Higher-wattage purchases usually lower your $/W due to volume and shipping efficiency.</li>

          <h2>Typical solar panel cost per watt</h2>
          <p>
            For consumer purchases, a common range is <strong>$0.40 to $1.20 per watt</strong> for panels alone. Lower values are more common
            for larger orders, while smaller one-off buys and premium products trend higher.

          <h2>How to estimate panel cost for your system</h2>
          <p>
            Start with the panel wattage you need, then multiply by your expected $/W.
          </p>
          <p class="pill"><strong>Panel cost</strong> ≈ (needed panel watts) × ($/W)</p>
          <p>
            Example: If you expect <strong>$0.65/W</strong> and you need <strong>2,000W</strong> of panels, panel cost is roughly
            <strong>$1,300</strong>.

          <h2>What changes solar panel $/W the most</h2>
          <h3>1) Total wattage purchased</h3>
          <p>
            Buying more watts usually improves $/W because the seller can reduce handling and shipping costs per panel.
          </p>
          <h3>2) Shipping and delivery method</h3>
          <p>
            Freight delivery can be cheaper per panel than standard shipping, but may require scheduling, a safe drop location, and inspection.
          </p>
          <h3>3) Panel type and brand tier</h3>
          <p>
            Higher-efficiency or premium-tier products can cost more per watt. Whether that “pays off” depends on roof space constraints and goals.
          </p>
          <h3>4) Warranty terms and product category</h3>
          <p>
            Panels with longer warranties or certain certifications can be priced higher. Compare like-for-like before concluding a panel is “overpriced.”

          <h2>Panels vs total system cost: avoid the common budgeting mistake</h2>
          <p>
            It’s easy to focus on panel $/W and forget the rest of the system. Typical add-ons include mounting hardware, wiring, protection devices,
            combiner boxes, inverter(s), and potentially batteries. Permits and labor (if not DIY) can also be major contributors.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <div class="faq">
            <div>
              <h4>Is a lower $/W always better?</h4>
              <p>No. Price should be compared alongside warranty, expected performance, compatibility with your mounting setup, and delivery reliability.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Why do small orders cost so much more per watt?</h4>
              <p>Shipping and handling are relatively fixed. When spread across fewer watts, the cost per watt increases.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Do higher-efficiency panels reduce total system cost?</h4>
              <p>Sometimes. If you’re limited by roof space, higher efficiency can reduce the number of panels and mounting hardware needed.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Should I budget panels as half the total cost?</h4>
              <p>Not reliably. In some systems, batteries or labor dominate. Use a full breakdown to estimate realistically.</p>
