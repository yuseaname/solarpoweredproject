        <p class="lede">
          Flywheels are one of the clearest “physics in your hands” energy experiments: you can feel stored energy as inertia, watch voltage rise with RPM,
          and see losses show up as heat and spin-down time. They’re also easy to misunderstand.
          This guide stays grounded: low-speed builds, realistic calculations, and safety limits that matter.

          <h2>Beginner explanation: what a flywheel does (and what it doesn’t)</h2>
          <p>
            A flywheel is a spinning mass that resists changes in speed. When you speed it up, you “store” energy in its rotation.
            When you slow it down, you “get” energy back out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two clarifications prevent most disappointment:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flywheels are power tools, not energy tanks.</strong> They can deliver a lot of power briefly, but don’t usually store many watt-hours at DIY scale.</li>
            <li><strong>They don’t create energy.</strong> They shift energy in time: from “when you have it” to “when you need it,” with losses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you want a quick refresher on the solar-side version of this concept (watts vs watt-hours), start with
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-basics.html">solar basics</a> and the
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/battery-capacity.html">battery capacity calculator</a>.

        <article id="how-it-works" class="article-card">
          <h2>How flywheels store and release energy</h2>
          <p>
            A flywheel system is usually four parts: the rotor (the spinning mass), bearings (which set losses), a motor/generator, and control electronics.
            Your “storage” is the rotor; your “efficiency” is mostly bearings + electrical conversion.
          </p>

          <h3>Energy storage in rotation</h3>
          <p>
            Rotational kinetic energy depends on two things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Moment of inertia (I)</strong>: how mass is distributed relative to the axis (mass near the rim counts a lot).</li>
            <li><strong>Angular speed (ω)</strong>: how fast it’s spinning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="article-meta">The speed term is squared. Doubling speed roughly quadruples energy.</p>

          <h3>Getting energy out</h3>
          <p>
            To “discharge” a flywheel, you load it with a generator so it slows down while producing electricity.
            As it slows, the generator’s voltage and power capability change, which is why practical systems use regulation.
          </p>

          <h3>Where the losses come from</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bearing friction</strong> and seal drag (continuous losses that cause spin-down).</li>
            <li><strong>Air drag</strong> on the rotor (often the biggest DIY loss; commercial flywheels use vacuum housings).</li>
            <li><strong>Electrical losses</strong> in rectifiers, converters, and wiring.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="safe-build-path" class="article-card">
          <h2>A safe DIY build path (Version 1 → Version 3)</h2>
          <p>
            If your goal is to learn, not to build a dangerous high-speed device, use an approach that stays “slow, visible, and contained.”
            Avoid the temptation to chase RPM.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 1: low-speed inertia demo (no electricity)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a <strong>bicycle wheel</strong> or heavy steel disk as the rotor.</li>
            <li>Mount it securely on a stable frame with good bearings.</li>
            <li>Add a simple, safe speed measurement (tape mark + optical tachometer, or a magnet + sensor).</li>
            <li>Spin it by hand and measure <strong>spin-down time</strong> from a known RPM to see losses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This alone teaches a lot: balancing, bearing quality, why air drag matters, and why “energy storage” can vanish surprisingly fast.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 2: generator coupling (measuring watts)</h3>
          <p>
            Add a generator in a way that lets you control load:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Belt/roller coupling</strong> from wheel to a small DC motor used as a generator.</li>
            <li>Rectify and regulate output before connecting to any battery or electronics.</li>
            <li>Start by powering a known resistive load (a resistor bank rated for the power) so behavior is predictable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Version 3: buffer use case (charging a small battery safely)</h3>
          <p>
            Once you can measure output and keep voltages predictable, you can use a flywheel as a buffer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Charge a small battery through a <strong>regulated charger stage</strong> (not a raw connection).</li>
            <li>Test “surge buffering” by running a load that pulses (or simulating pulses) and observing how the flywheel reduces peak draw from the source.</li>
          </ul>

          </div>
        </article>

        <article id="math" class="article-card">
          <h2>The math: energy vs RPM (with real examples)</h2>
          <p>
            Rotational energy is:
            <strong>E = ½ I ω²</strong>
            where <strong>I</strong> is moment of inertia and <strong>ω</strong> is angular speed in radians per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            To convert RPM to ω:
            <strong>ω = 2π × RPM / 60</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>Example A: a “DIY friendly” bicycle wheel</h3>
          <p>
            A typical bicycle wheel’s moment of inertia depends on tire, rim, spokes, and hub.
            For a rough learning estimate, assume <strong>I ≈ 0.12 kg·m²</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>At 300 RPM: ω ≈ 31.4 rad/s → E ≈ ½ × 0.12 × 31.4² ≈ 59 J (≈ 0.016 Wh)</li>
            <li>At 600 RPM: ω ≈ 62.8 rad/s → E ≈ 235 J (≈ 0.065 Wh)</li>
            <li>At 1200 RPM: ω ≈ 125.7 rad/s → E ≈ 940 J (≈ 0.26 Wh)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="article-meta">
            This is the “reality check” moment: even at 1200 RPM, a bicycle wheel stores a fraction of a watt-hour. That doesn’t make it useless — it makes it a short-duration buffer.
          </p>

          <h3>Example B: heavier rotor, still modest energy</h3>
          <p>
            Suppose you build a heavier steel rotor with <strong>I = 1.0 kg·m²</strong> (already substantial for DIY).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>At 600 RPM: E ≈ ½ × 1.0 × 62.8² ≈ 1,971 J (≈ 0.55 Wh)</li>
            <li>At 1200 RPM: E ≈ 7,885 J (≈ 2.19 Wh)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Two takeaways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To store meaningful watt-hours, you need either very large inertia, very high RPM, or both.</li>
            <li>High RPM is where DIY safety risks explode. Commercial flywheels solve this with advanced materials, containment, and vacuum housings.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="expected-output" class="article-card">
          <h2>Expected output and losses (what “useful” looks like)</h2>
          <p>
            The most honest way to think about a DIY flywheel is as a system that can:
            <strong>absorb power for short periods</strong> and
            <strong>deliver power for short periods</strong>,
            while slowly bleeding energy through friction and drag.
          </p>

          <h3>Power vs energy: an intuitive example</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine your flywheel stores 2 Wh (which is already non-trivial for a DIY rotor).
            It could theoretically supply:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>120W for about 1 minute, or</li>
            <li>60W for about 2 minutes, or</li>
            <li>20W for about 6 minutes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="article-meta">Real systems deliver less because voltage falls with RPM and conversion losses stack up.</p>

          <h3>Why regulation matters</h3>
          <p>
            Generator output tends to rise with RPM. If you connect raw output to a battery or load, you can get:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overvoltage at high RPM (risking electronics), and</li>
            <li>Undervoltage at low RPM (wasting remaining stored energy).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A regulated stage (rectifier + buck/boost converter or a proper charge controller) helps you use more of the stored energy safely.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="measurement" class="article-card">
          <h2>Measurement checklist (RPM, watts, temperature)</h2>
          <p>
            Flywheel projects get safer and more useful the moment you start measuring.
            Without data, people tend to chase speed, overbuild, or misread what’s happening.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimum measurements for a “Version 1” build</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>RPM</strong>: optical tachometer, sensor + magnet, or a known-timing method.</li>
            <li><strong>Spin-down time</strong>: time from a known RPM to a lower RPM (same enclosure, same conditions).</li>
            <li><strong>Vibration</strong>: subjective is okay at first; if vibration increases with speed, stop and rebalance.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Measurements that make Version 2/3 work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Voltage and current</strong> into a known load (so you can compute watts).</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature</strong> of the generator and any converters during a timed run.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeatability</strong>: run the same test twice; if output varies a lot, fix mechanics before scaling.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="article-meta">
            If output looks “fine” unloaded but collapses under load, that’s not failure — it’s the core lesson: power only counts under load.

        <article id="mistakes" class="article-card">
          <h2>Common mistakes and misconceptions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“It spins fast so it must store a lot.”</strong> Speed matters, but so does inertia — and safe speeds are usually lower than people assume.</li>
            <li><strong>Confusing smoothness with stored energy.</strong> A flywheel can make motion feel steady even when it stores very little energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Skipping measurement.</strong> If you can’t measure RPM and watts, you can’t improve the design safely.</li>
            <li><strong>Connecting raw generator output to a battery.</strong> Use regulation, fusing, and disconnects like any other off-grid circuit.</li>
            <li><strong>Underestimating air drag.</strong> A simple cover can change spin-down behavior dramatically.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="safety" class="article-card">
          <h2>Safety and limitations</h2>
          <p>
            A flywheel is a rotating projectile source. Failure modes are not “gentle.”
            If you want to explore high energy density, do it with a commercial-rated product and proper safety engineering — not an improvised DIY rotor.
          </p>

          <h3>Practical DIY safety rules</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Containment:</strong> build an enclosure that protects you from debris if a part fails.</li>
            <li><strong>No brittle materials:</strong> avoid cast iron, questionable welds, cracked rims, or unknown composite layups.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance:</strong> vibration is a warning sign; stop and fix it before increasing speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Guards:</strong> cover belts/rollers and spinning parts; avoid loose clothing/hair near rotation.</li>
            <li><strong>Electrical protection:</strong> fuse near the battery and use a disconnect. See the site’s
              <a class="text-link" href="../pages/wiring-decisions.html">wiring decisions checklist</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Why “high RPM flywheel builds” are a different category</h3>
          <p>
            Above a certain speed, the energy density gets interesting — but so do the stresses.
            Stress rises with speed too, and failures become violent.
            This guide intentionally focuses on low-speed educational builds.

        <article id="pairs-with-solar" class="article-card">
          <h2>How a flywheel pairs with solar (without overcomplicating your system)</h2>
          <p>
            In most off-grid systems, solar + batteries handle the “energy” job well.
            A flywheel can add value when you want to smooth <strong>short peaks</strong> or build intuition about storage and conversion.
          </p>

          <h3>Good pairing use cases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Buffering short surges</strong> so a small generator (pedal, wind gusts) feels steadier.</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching tool</strong> for system thinking: what happens to voltage, current, and losses as energy flows.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When batteries are the better answer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you need <strong>hours</strong> of backup power or meaningful kWh.</li>
            <li>If you want simplicity and predictable behavior.</li>

          <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
          <h3>The wheel spins well, but I get almost no watts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Check that your generator is actually loaded (a meter showing voltage alone is not enough).</li>
            <li>Confirm drive ratio: many generators need higher RPM than the rotor provides.</li>
            <li>Look for slipping belts/rollers under load.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Output voltage is unstable</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Add regulation (buck/boost converter or a proper charging stage).</li>
            <li>Shorten and thicken wiring if you’re working at low voltage (voltage drop causes instability).</li>
            <li>Check connections: loose lugs act like resistors and create heat.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Vibration increases as RPM rises</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Stop and rebalance. Don’t “push through” vibration.</li>
            <li>Inspect bearings and mounts for play.</li>

              <h4>Do flywheels store more energy than batteries?</h4>
              <p>
                Not at DIY scale. Batteries store far more energy per kilogram for most practical setups.
                Flywheels can deliver high power quickly, which makes them useful as buffers.

              <h4>Why do flywheels feel powerful if the watt-hours are small?</h4>
              <p>
                Because power and energy are different. A flywheel can deliver a lot of power briefly, even if the total stored energy is small.

              <h4>Can I connect a flywheel generator directly to a battery?</h4>
              <p>
                It’s risky. Generator voltage changes with RPM and can overshoot. Use a regulated charging stage and proper protection.

              <h4>What’s the simplest “Version 1” flywheel project?</h4>
              <p>
                A bicycle wheel on a stable frame with an RPM measurement, then documenting spin-down time from a known speed to see losses.

              <h4>What’s a safer “energy storage” experiment if I want more watt-hours?</h4>
              <p>
                A battery (even a small one) is usually simpler and safer. If you want a pure physics experiment, see the
