        <h1 class="article-title">DIY Supercapacitor Bank for Solar: How to Buffer Surges Safely (With the Math)</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          Supercapacitors (supercaps) are one of the most misunderstood “storage” technologies in DIY off-grid work.
          They can dump huge current and recharge fast — which makes them perfect for smoothing short surges and protecting batteries from abuse.
          But they usually store <em>very little</em> energy compared to batteries.
          This guide shows what supercaps are good for, how to size them honestly, and how to build a safe experiment with balancing and protection.

          <h2>Beginner explanation: supercaps are “power buffers,” not “energy tanks”</h2>
          <p>
            Batteries are good at storing lots of energy. Supercapacitors are good at moving energy quickly.
            That difference matters in off-grid systems because many real-world problems are <strong>short, sharp events</strong>:
            inrush current, motor start surges, momentary load spikes, and rapid charge acceptance from experimental generators.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’ve ever watched an inverter complain when a fridge starts, or watched voltage sag when a pump kicks on, you’ve seen “power problems.”
            Supercaps can help with those — but only if you design the system around their limits.
          </p>

          <h2>What supercaps are good for (and not)</h2>
          <h3>Great use cases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Surge buffering:</strong> reduce voltage sag during short load spikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Inrush smoothing:</strong> help with motor starts or converter startup bursts.</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental source buffering:</strong> smooth output from wind/pedal/hydro experiments before conversion.</li>
            <li><strong>Regenerative capture demos:</strong> capture short bursts (hand-crank, spin-down energy) into a buffer.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Usually not worth it</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Long backup runtime:</strong> hours of energy storage belongs to batteries.</li>
            <li><strong>Replacing batteries entirely:</strong> supercaps become enormous and expensive for kWh storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct connection without protection:</strong> uncontrolled inrush and imbalance are common failure modes.</li>

        <article id="how-it-works" class="article-card">
          <h2>How supercapacitors work (useful mental model)</h2>
          <p>
            You can think of a capacitor as an “electric spring.”
            Push charge in and voltage rises. Pull charge out and voltage falls.
            Batteries, in contrast, try to hold roughly the same voltage across a wide range of state of charge.
          </p>

          <h3>Voltage droop is normal</h3>
          <p>
            A supercap bank does not deliver a flat voltage like a battery.
            Its voltage changes directly with how much charge is stored.
            That means you often need a DC-DC converter if your load expects a stable voltage.
          </p>

          <h3>Internal resistance (ESR) matters</h3>
          <p>
            Supercaps are popular because ESR can be very low, enabling high current.
            But even small resistance at high current causes heat, and it adds to voltage drop during surges.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="math" class="article-card">
          <h2>The math: energy, voltage droop, and “usable” capacity</h2>
          <p>
            The stored energy in a capacitor is:
          </p>
          <p class="article-meta"><strong>E = ½ C V²</strong></p>
          <p>
            Where E is energy (joules), C is capacitance (farads), and V is voltage.
            To convert joules to watt-hours, divide by 3600.
          </p>

          <h3>Example: why supercaps often store less energy than people expect</h3>
          <p>
            Suppose you build a 12V-ish bank using supercaps and you end up with an effective capacitance of 100F at 16V max.
            At 16V, energy is 0.5 × 100 × 16² = 12,800J ≈ 3.6Wh.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s not a typo: a bank that feels “big” can still store single-digit watt-hours.
            The benefit is not energy density — it’s fast charge/discharge and surge current capability.
          </p>

          <h3>Usable energy depends on allowed voltage range</h3>
          <p>
            If your load requires at least 12V, and your bank starts at 16V and droops to 12V, your usable energy is the difference:
            ½ C (Vstart² − Vend²).
            This is why regulating voltage (buck/boost) can increase usable energy by letting you use a wider voltage swing.

        <article id="build" class="article-card">
          <h2>DIY build path (Version 1 → Version 3)</h2>
          <p>
            Start with a small, controlled demo. Your goal is to prove you understand precharge, balancing, and measurement.
            Then scale.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 1: single cell demo (learn precharge and measurement)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Charge a single supercap with a current-limited source.</li>
            <li>Measure voltage rise over time.</li>
            <li>Discharge into a known resistor and measure current and temperature.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This teaches the most important lesson: voltage changes constantly, and current can be very large.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 2: small series bank + balancing</h3>
          <p>
            Series connections increase voltage rating but reduce effective capacitance.
            This is where balancing becomes mandatory.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Build a series string sized for your target voltage.</li>
            <li>Add balancing (passive resistors or an active balancing module).</li>
            <li>Add a fuse and a disconnect.</li>
            <li>Charge through a precharge resistor so inrush is controlled.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Version 3: buffered DC bus for an off-grid experiment</h3>
          <p>
            Once you can charge/discharge safely, you can use a supercap bank as a DC bus buffer.
            Common examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buffering a hand-crank or pedal generator so voltage doesn’t spike wildly.</li>
            <li>Smoothing a load surge so a battery sees gentler current.</li>
            <li>Reducing voltage sag for an inverter during short motor starts.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="balancing" class="article-card">
          <h2>Balancing basics for series strings</h2>
          <p>
            In a series string, each cell should share voltage evenly.
            In practice, leakage currents differ, so one cell can drift higher and exceed its voltage rating.
            Overvoltage can permanently damage a cell.
          </p>

          <h3>Passive balancing (simple, constant loss)</h3>
          <p>
            Passive balancing uses resistors across each cell.
            It’s simple and often adequate for small DIY banks, but it wastes energy as heat continuously.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose resistor values that create balancing current above expected leakage variation.</li>
            <li>Confirm resistor watt rating and temperature rise.</li>
            <li>Accept that it’s always “leaking” energy by design.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Active balancing (more complex, less loss)</h3>
          <p>
            Active balancers move charge between cells.
            They reduce standby loss and can be better for larger banks, but they add components and failure modes.
            For DIY learning, passive balancing is often enough.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="inrush" class="article-card">
          <h2>Precharge and inrush limiting (don’t skip this)</h2>
          <p>
            An empty supercap bank looks like a short circuit.
            If you connect it directly to a battery, the inrush current can be enormous — limited only by wiring resistance and ESR.
          </p>

          <h3>Simple precharge method</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a resistor in series for initial charging.</li>
            <li>Once voltage is close, bypass the resistor with a switch or relay.</li>
            <li>Measure current during precharge and watch temperatures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is also why a disconnect and fusing matter.

        <article id="pairs-with-solar" class="article-card">
          <h2>How it pairs with solar + batteries</h2>
          <p>
            The most realistic use of supercaps in a solar setup is as a <strong>buffer in front of a battery</strong>.
            Batteries don’t love sharp current spikes; supercaps do.
            A good buffer design can reduce stress on batteries and stabilize a DC bus.
          </p>
          <h3>Two practical “buffer” patterns</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cap bank on a regulated DC bus:</strong> a DC-DC stage maintains a stable bus voltage while the supercaps absorb fast spikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cap bank near the surge load:</strong> short, thick wiring near the inverter or motor load reduces sag at the point that matters.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In both cases, the supercaps should not be treated as “just another battery.”
            Their voltage droops quickly, so a converter and a clear allowable voltage range are what turn a supercap bank from a science demo into a useful buffer.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a DC-DC stage to manage supercap voltage droop.</li>
            <li>Fuse both battery and supercap branches; treat each as an energy source.</li>
            <li>Keep wiring short and appropriately sized.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>High current is the main hazard</h3>
          <p>
            Supercap banks can deliver extremely high current into a short.
            That can melt tools, start fires, and damage batteries.
            Always fuse near energy sources and keep conductors protected.
          </p>

          <h3>Cell overvoltage</h3>
          <p>
            Overvoltage can damage cells and create venting hazards.
            Use balancing and conservative voltage limits.
          </p>

          <h3>Don’t use questionable salvaged cells without testing</h3>
          <p>
            If you salvage cells from unknown sources, test them individually for leakage and capacity behavior first.
            Mixed cell health is a recipe for imbalance.

          <h3>My bank charges fast at first, then slows down</h3>

            That’s normal. As voltage rises, current-limited chargers deliver less current, and the voltage difference driving current shrinks.

              <h4>Can supercapacitors replace a battery in an off-grid solar system?</h4>
              <p>
                Usually no. For hours of runtime, batteries are far more energy-dense and cost-effective.
                Supercaps shine as buffers for short surges and rapid charge/discharge events.

            <div>
              <h4>Why does voltage drop so quickly when I draw current?</h4>
              <p>
                Because capacitors don’t regulate voltage like batteries.
                As charge is removed, voltage falls. A DC-DC converter can make that voltage swing more usable.

            <div>
              <h4>Do I need balancing for series banks?</h4>
              <p>
                Yes. Without balancing, one cell can exceed its voltage rating even if the total bank voltage looks safe.

            <div>
              <h4>What’s the biggest danger in DIY supercap projects?</h4>
              <p>
