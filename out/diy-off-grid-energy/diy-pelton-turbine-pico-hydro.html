        <p class="lede">
          If you have a stream, a spring box, or even a tank you can drain, a small “pico hydro” turbine is one of the best
          hands-on ways to learn power, losses, and why water energy is both amazing and unforgiving.
          This guide focuses on a Pelton-style setup: a high-velocity jet hitting small buckets.
          You’ll build it for learning and measurement first, then for safe trickle charging if your site supports it.

          <h2>Beginner explanation: what “pico hydro” actually means</h2>
          <p>
            Pico hydro usually means “small enough to be a DIY experiment,” often from a few watts to a few hundred watts.
            It’s not magic. You’re converting <strong>gravity potential energy</strong> in water (height) into <strong>electrical power</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two ideas keep expectations honest:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Head</strong> is pressure from height (how far the water drops).</li>
            <li><strong>Flow</strong> is how much water per second you can move through a nozzle.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A Pelton turbine prefers a strong, fast jet. That generally means you have some usable head (even 5–30 meters is common in “small but real” sites),
            and your flow is moderate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re new to watts vs watt-hours, read
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-basics.html">solar basics</a>
            and use the
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/battery-capacity.html">battery capacity calculator</a>
            so your hydro experiment is grounded in daily energy needs.
          </p>

        <article id="site-check" class="article-card">
          <h2>Site check: head, flow, and seasonality</h2>
          <h3>Measure head the simple way</h3>
          <p>
            You can estimate head with a hose and a pressure gauge, or by measuring elevation difference between intake and turbine with mapping tools.
            For DIY, you don’t need survey-grade numbers — you need “is this 2m, 10m, or 50m?”
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Low head</strong> (0.5–3m): a water wheel or low-head turbine tends to make more sense.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium head</strong> (3–20m): small turbines can work; pipe friction becomes important.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher head</strong> (20m+): Pelton-style designs become attractive (and the jet can be dangerous).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Estimate flow without fancy tools</h3>
          <p>
            Use a bucket-and-timer test at the intake point if possible.
            If the stream is too large, test a small diversion line: you care about the flow you can safely and legally capture.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Measure bucket volume (liters).</li>
            <li>Time how many seconds it takes to fill.</li>
            <li>Flow (L/s) = liters ÷ seconds.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reality check: seasonality and debris</h3>
          <p>
            Hydro output can vary massively by season. In many places, summer flow is a fraction of spring flow.
            Also plan for debris: leaves, sand, and ice are “hydro taxes” that show up as clogged intakes and eroded nozzles.

        <article id="how-it-works" class="article-card">
          <h2>How a Pelton turbine works (the short, useful version)</h2>
          <p>
            A Pelton turbine is an “impulse turbine.” Water exits a nozzle as a high-speed jet, hits the runner buckets, and transfers momentum.
            Unlike a water wheel that is pushed by slow-moving water, a Pelton runner is driven by <strong>jet velocity</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>What the buckets do</h3>
          <p>
            Efficient Pelton buckets split the jet and turn it nearly 180°.
            That direction change is the whole trick: changing momentum gives you force on the wheel.
            DIY versions often use “spoon buckets” or 3D-printed cups to approximate this.
          </p>

          <h3>Where the losses come from</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pipe friction</strong> (long/skinny pipe turns head into heat).</li>
            <li><strong>Nozzle losses</strong> (a poor nozzle makes a spray, not a jet).</li>
            <li><strong>Runner splash</strong> (water hits wrong angle or re-hits buckets).</li>
            <li><strong>Bearing and generator losses</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Electrical mismatch</strong> (wrong load: you “stall” the turbine or spin it unloaded).</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article id="build" class="article-card">
          <h2>A practical DIY build (Version 1 → Version 3)</h2>
          <p>
            Start with a measurement-focused build. Your first win is not “charging a big battery.”
            Your first win is: <strong>repeatable RPM and repeatable watts</strong> from a known head and flow.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 1: the runner + safe test stand (learning build)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Runner:</strong> a small disk (plywood, aluminum, or 3D print) with spoon-like cups evenly spaced.</li>
            <li><strong>Shaft:</strong> straight rod with real bearings (skate bearings can work at low loads).</li>
            <li><strong>Containment:</strong> a splash box or tote bin so water is captured and the jet can’t wander.</li>
            <li><strong>RPM measurement:</strong> cheap optical tachometer or magnet + hall sensor.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Drive it with a hose or a small pump at modest pressure first. The goal is to check balance, splash behavior, and mounting rigidity.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 2: add a generator and load control</h3>
          <p>
            You need a way to convert rotation into electricity and a way to control the load.
            A practical DIY approach is a permanent-magnet DC motor used as a generator, plus a load you can adjust.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Generator:</strong> PMDC motor, treadmill motor, or scooter motor.</li>
            <li><strong>Coupling:</strong> belt drive so you can change ratio easily.</li>
            <li><strong>Load:</strong> a DC buck converter feeding a resistive load, or a dump-load resistor bank.</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> a DC watt meter (volts, amps, watts) on the output.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Avoid “voltage only” testing. Open-circuit voltage is easy to get and tells you almost nothing about usable power.
          </p>

          <h3>Version 3: move to real water with proper intake basics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intake:</strong> screened to keep out rocks and leaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Settling:</strong> if you have sand, consider a small settling bucket or strainer stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Penstock (pipe):</strong> sized to reduce friction losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Nozzle:</strong> a stable jet you can aim and adjust.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you want the “bigger picture” first, read
            <a class="text-link" href="micro-hydro-basics-for-off-grid-power.html">micro-hydro basics</a>
            before committing to pipe length and diameter.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="nozzle" class="article-card">
          <h2>Nozzles, pipe, and “why my jet is weak”</h2>
          <h3>Your nozzle diameter controls flow (and jet quality)</h3>
          <p>
            A smaller nozzle increases jet velocity for a given pressure, but it also reduces flow.
            A larger nozzle increases flow, but if your pipe and head can’t support it, the jet turns into a sad spray.
          </p>
          <p>
            For DIY learning, it’s helpful to build a nozzle block where you can swap tips (different drilled sizes) and record watts for each.
            This turns your turbine into a science experiment instead of a one-shot project.
          </p>

          <h3>Penstock friction is the invisible thief</h3>
          <p>
            Long, narrow pipe can eat your available head before the nozzle.
            The symptom is familiar: your intake has head, but the nozzle pressure is low.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shorter pipe helps.</li>
            <li>Bigger diameter helps (often more than you expect).</li>
            <li>Smoother pipe and fewer sharp elbows help.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Use a pressure gauge at the nozzle if you can</h3>
          <p>
            A small gauge near the nozzle is one of the most useful debugging tools.
            It tells you whether your issue is “not enough head/flow” or “mechanical/electrical mismatch.”

        <article id="math" class="article-card">
          <h2>Realistic power math (with examples)</h2>
          <p>
            The simplest hydro estimate is:
          </p>
          <p class="article-meta"><strong>Hydraulic power (W) ≈ 9.81 × head(m) × flow(L/s)</strong></p>
          <p>
            That is the power in the water before turbine and electrical losses.
            A DIY system might end up at 20–60% overall efficiency depending on build quality and operating point.
          </p>

          <h3>Example 1: “Small but real” creek site</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Head: 12m</li>
            <li>Flow: 1.5 L/s</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Water power ≈ 9.81 × 12 × 1.5 ≈ <strong>176W</strong>.
            If your total efficiency is 40%, you might see ~<strong>70W</strong> electrical on a stable load.
          </p>
          <p>
            70W continuous is ~1.68 kWh/day. That’s meaningful for lights, device charging, and small refrigeration — but only if flow stays consistent.
          </p>

          <h3>Example 2: Backyard experiment with a tank</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Head: 3m</li>
            <li>Flow: 0.5 L/s</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Water power ≈ 9.81 × 3 × 0.5 ≈ <strong>15W</strong>.
            At 30% overall efficiency, that’s ~<strong>5W</strong> electrical.
            It’s a great experiment, but it won’t charge a large battery quickly.
          </p>

          <h3>Why “RPM” and “voltage” can mislead you</h3>
          <p>
            A turbine can spin fast with almost no load, producing impressive voltage.
            But real power requires current.
            The moment you connect a real load, the turbine slows — and your job is to match the load so you get the most watts without stalling.
          </p>

        <article id="charging" class="article-card">
          <h2>Charging a battery safely (the battery-first approach)</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to store your energy, don’t connect an unpredictable DIY generator directly to a battery and hope.
            Use regulation, protection, and a wiring layout you trust.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimum safe architecture</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Generator → rectifier</strong> (if AC) → <strong>regulator/charger</strong> → <strong>fuse</strong> → <strong>battery</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Dump load</strong> or current limiting so runaway voltage doesn’t cook electronics when the battery is full.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect</strong> so you can stop the experiment instantly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For protection fundamentals, see
            <a class="text-link" href="../pages/solar-fuse-and-breaker-sizing.html">fuse and breaker sizing</a>

          </p>

          <h3>Don’t skip wire size</h3>
          <p>
            Small systems often run at low voltage (12V), which means higher current for the same power.
            Voltage drop and hot wires show up fast.

          <h3>Jet safety and containment</h3>
          <p>
            A high-head jet can cut skin and inject debris. Treat it like a pressure washer.
            Use a splash box, point the nozzle into containment, and keep your hands away from the jet path.

            Even “small” systems can create dangerous currents.
            Fuse close to the battery, and use a disconnect.

            <li>Check for air leaks upstream (air makes the jet unstable).</li>
            <li>Reduce nozzle diameter and test again.</li>
            <li>Check that your pipe diameter isn’t choking flow.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Power rises then falls as I load it</h3>
          <p>
            That’s normal. There’s a “sweet spot” where turbine speed and load match.
            If you overload it, RPM collapses and watts can drop.
            Use adjustable loading so you can find the best operating point.

              <h4>How much power can a DIY Pelton turbine make?</h4>
              <p>
                It depends on head and flow. Use watts ≈ 9.81 × head(m) × flow(L/s), then multiply by an efficiency estimate.
                Many DIY builds land in the tens of watts unless the site has strong head and consistent flow.

              <h4>Is a Pelton turbine better than a water wheel?</h4>
              <p>
                Pelton-style turbines generally win when you have higher head and can make a fast jet.
                Water wheels are often better for very low head where you have lots of slow flow.

              <h4>Can I charge a 12V battery directly from the generator?</h4>
              <p>
                It’s risky. Generator voltage and current change with RPM and load.
                Use a proper charging stage, fusing near the battery, and a way to prevent overvoltage when the battery is full.

              <h4>What’s the simplest way to increase output?</h4>
              <p>
                Reduce losses first: larger pipe (less friction), a cleaner nozzle jet, better bearings, and better load matching.
                “More buckets” rarely fixes a poor jet or undersized penstock.
